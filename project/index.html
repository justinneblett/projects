            What made him underrepresented?
        </h3>
        <p>
            He is considered underrepresented because he is an African American. In working closely with law enforcement, he is aware of instances of police brutality, aiming to weed out racism in policing, yet acknowledged that it can also be a hindrance (Lynn).
